LINKS USED FOR IMAGES
Storing images as Base64 strings increases the size of the data being transferred between the server and the client. This can lead to slower loading times, especially for larger images. By using links to external images, only the URLs of the images need to be transmitted, reducing the data size and improving performance.

DATABASE UPDATED IN INTERVALS
Updating the database in intervals helps ensure consistency by synchronizing updates at regular intervals. This approach minimizes the risk of  inconsistencies that may occur when processing updates in real-time, resulting in a more robust and reliable system.
